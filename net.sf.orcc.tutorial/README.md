# RVC CAL Tutorial

RVC CAL is a [standardized](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=66155) version of the [CAL Actor Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAL_Actor_Language) which implements [dataflow model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) of computation.

All the examples of this tutorial are written for and tested with ORCC tools.

[Open RVC CAL Compiler (ORCC)](http://orcc.sourceforge.net/) is an open-source Integrated Development Environment based on Eclipse and dedicated to dataflow programming. The primary purpose of Orcc is to provide developers with a compiler infrastructure to allow software/hardware code to be generated from dataflow descriptions.
